# rock-paper-scissors
This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors Game in which you play against the computer. It is one of the projects in the Odin Project.

This project helped me understand: 
* how to randomly select items from an array
* the importance of scope in Javascript
* how to use a loop
* how to use event listeners
